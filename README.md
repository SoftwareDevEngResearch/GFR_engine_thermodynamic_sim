Welcome to GFR_engine_thermodynamic_sim,  this package is a simulation module 
designed for the use of the 2018 Global Formula Racing team.  The simulation
which is coded in Python is a Combustion Engine Simulation which is deigned to
optimize different parameters for maximum power or maximum efficiency.  The Simulation
is complete module that is based on three categories Mechanical, Heat
Transfer and Thermodynamic.  These three categories encompass the entirety of
the energy within the system.
